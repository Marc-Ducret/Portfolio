        Our OS for the x86 architecture accumulated the following features. It can schedule multiple\
        processes, each having its own virtual memory. Any process can chose to display things, if\
        multiple active processes do so, the user can chose which one to look at. Programs can be\
        developed in C using a custom 'standard library'. Many Syscalls are implemented and enable, among\
        other things, a Filesystem, communication between processes and dynamic memory allocation.\
        A basic shell program is implemented."
