                    This project aimed at learning to control a vision based robotic arm through imitation of an expert.
                    Such a situation is simulated using the \"FetchPickAndPlace\" environment from OpenAI.
                    To solve the task, the arm should grab the cube and take it to the red target."},

                    An expert can be easily programmed using the 3D positions of objects. It is then interesting to
                    learn a policy that does not have access to those positions and instead relies on vision.
                    With enough graphical variations we could even hope that this policy could perform well in
                    the real world."},

                    Our work was based on an implementation of Behavioral Cloning from Robin Strudel. Our contribution
                    was to implement and experiment with DAgger and DART which are Imitation Learning algorithms.

                    During this project, we designed a Reinforcement Learning environment that involved graphs and
                    experimented with novel Deep Neural Network architectures that exploit the graph structure.
                    The environment was basically a grid with walls and a vacuum cleaner that should move around
                    and clean dust. For more details, check out the
