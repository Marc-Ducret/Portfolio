        The environment is the inside of a sphere. You can walk everywhere inside it and gravity pulls away\
        from the center of the sphere. This was a bit of a technical challenge to have the player\
        facing the right way but after some thinking we ended up with simple and elegant solutions.\
        Basically, at each time frame, we apply on the player the smallest rotation such that the player\
        becomes aligned with gravity."
