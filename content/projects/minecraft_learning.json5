      text: "\
        This project was developed during my 5 months academic internship at USC, Los Angeles.\
        Under the supervision of Fei Sha, my task was to develop a learning framework within Minecraft.\
        This framework was aimed at Imitation Learning and Reinforcement Learning. I also experimented\
        with opportunities for learning task using Minecraft."

        The long term goal is to use Minecraft to experiment with learning in the context of human\
        societal behaviour."

      title: "A new Framework",
      text: "\
        The resulting framework has many features. It can help with Imitation Learning by providing\
        convenient solutions to record gameplay. Reinforcement Learning environments can easily be\
        implemented and some input and output spaced are already defined. The main feature is to\
        allow usage of Python agents and fast game execution to speed up learning."
