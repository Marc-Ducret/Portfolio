       Dice Kingdoms is a multiplayer turn based strategy game where players must carefully place buildings on their\
       island. They must prepare for natural disasters and attacks from other players. Strategic planning and awareness\
       are key to success.\

       Progress is mainly made through building, to increase resource production, unlock technologies or work towards\
       a victory condition using culture, military or building a wonder.\
       The layout of buildings is crucial as space is limited and touching buildings are prone to diseases if not also\
       adjacent to an hospital."
