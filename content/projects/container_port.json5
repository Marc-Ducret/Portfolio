        In the port, there are some road that vehicles follow. However I had no GPS data for those roads shapes and\
        locations. Since I had access to (noisy) data of the movements of machines in the port I designed and\
        implemented a custom clustering algorithm that was able to infer the roads."

        In order to test optimisation algorithms, a simulation of a whole port is required. It is a very complex system\
        and therefore unforeseen consequences can happen.\

        I started implementing a simulator and made it compatible with the visualisation tool."
